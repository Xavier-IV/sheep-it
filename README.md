# 🐑 Sheep It

**Your GitHub Issues become PRDs. Claude implements them.**

A simple workflow for solo devs. Sheep It uses GitHub Issues as your spec, then Claude actually writes the code. One command to brainstorm, one to implement, one to ship.

## 30-Second Install

```bash
# 1. Install Sheep It
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xavier-IV/sheep-it/master/install.sh | bash

# 2. Authenticate GitHub (if not already)
gh auth login && gh auth refresh -h github.com -s project,read:project

# 3. Setup in your project
/sheep:init
```

Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/).

## See It In Action

### Step 1: Brainstorm a task
```
/sheep:task "Add user login"
```
Claude asks clarifying questions, refines scope, and creates a GitHub Issue with acceptance criteria. **The issue IS your PRD.**

### Step 2: Claude implements it
```
/sheep:start 22
```
Claude reads the issue as the spec, writes the code, commits incrementally, and auto-checks acceptance criteria as it completes them.

### Step 3: Ship it
```
/sheep:it 22
```
Creates a PR linked to the issue. When merged, issue auto-closes. Done.

## Why I Built This

I'm a solo dev who wanted something simple. I kept losing context when Claude reset, and managing `.planning/` folders felt like overhead for my small projects.

GitHub Issues already have everything I need:
- They survive Claude context resets (your spec is always there)
- Built-in tracking: checkboxes, labels, milestones, projects
- `/sheep:resume` recovers state instantly by reading git + issues
- No extra files to manage

This is just a personal tool I built for myself. If it helps you too, great!

## Configuration (Optional)

Create `.sheeprc.yml` or run `/sheep:config`:

```yaml
branch:
  prefix: "feature"
  format: "{prefix}/{issue}-{slug}"

commits:
  style: "conventional"  # feat:, fix:, chore:

auto_update:
  check_criteria: true   # Auto-check acceptance criteria
  progress_comments: true
```

## Philosophy

GitHub already has all the infrastructure for project management. Sheep It just connects the dots:

- **Issues** → Your PRD / spec
- **Milestones** → Version planning
- **Projects** → Kanban board
- **Checkboxes** → Acceptance criteria (auto-updated!)
- **Git state** → Progress tracking

Keep it simple. Use what's already there.

## Uninstall

To remove Sheep It from your system:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xavier-IV/sheep-it/master/uninstall.sh | bash
```

This removes the `~/.claude/commands/sheep` directory. Your project files and GitHub data are untouched.
